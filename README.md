# Generational-Evolution-Strategy-Algorithm

This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a canonical generational Evolutionary Strategy algorithm for the optimization of complex black-box objective functions defined over a multi-dimensional real space. Candidate solutions are generated as n-dimensional vectors and treated through standard genetic operations of recombination, mutation and selection. The benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to set up such operators can be evaluated in different contexts. We applied our algorithm to 24 noise-free real-parameter single-objective benchmark functions (BOBB suite) with different characteristics and properties implemented in the python IOHexperimenter package for heuristic optimization. To further explore the potentiality of our algorithm, we examined the performance of the objective function ensemble on three different space dimensions: 2-dimensional, 5-dimensional and 20-dimensional. Even if carefully tailored to our setting, our approach strives towards re-usability and our functions can be easily adapted to multiple scripts and contexts.

## The implementation 
Three different versions of the Evolution Strategy algorithm are being proposed exploiting three distinct candidate solution representation and genetic operators: the one-sigma strategy, the individual sigma strategy and the individual sigma strategy with correlated dimensions. 

### The representation
The individuals in the population are randomly generated solutions (with all dimensions embedded in the interval [-5,5]). Each individual is made of a vector of real numbers associated with a step-size vector indicated with the Greek letter sigma. The step size acts as standard deviation of a normal distribution centred at 0 from which random variates are drawn at each step to update the multi-dimensional vector of solutions. In the one-sigma representation, a single step-size value is used to control all dimensions of the vector of solutions. In the individual sigma strategy, the step-size is a vector with the same dimensionality as the vector of solutions, such that the i^{th} element of the step-size vector parametrizes the normal random variable used to update the ith dimension of the condidate solution. The last approach, in addition to a step-size vector, binds each solution with a vector of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{n \times (n-1)}{2} "> rotational angles between each pair of dimension. The mutation magnitude and direction in this last scenario is obtained as a vector of variates from a multi-dimensional normal distribution parametrized by a covariance matrix.
